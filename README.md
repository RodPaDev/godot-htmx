# Proof of Concept for HTMX with Godot

Basic http server in Godot and templating system for html.
The idea for the future, once I learn more about godot is to create a game called "req_runner".

In this game you a req_runner, will have to complete REST requests by finding the right method gate, shooting your way through errors and much more.
The idea is to combine browser and a game client serving as a server as well as a game client lol.

There is no reason to have the browser part as I could simulate it in the game but this is more memeful.
